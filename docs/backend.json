    "reasoning": "This design prioritizes security and scalability for handling contact form submissions. All submissions are stored in a single collection, `/contact_form_submissions`, making listing submissions straightforward. No authorization dependencies exist as the dashboard will likely require admin access, which will be implemented out-of-scope using a separate authentication and role management system, as per the DBAC principle (Database Authentication and Authorization). This allows for future expansion without impacting the core security model of contact form submissions. The structure is simple and avoids any complex authorization rules, enabling efficient queries and updates."
